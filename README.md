# Fibonacci Heap Visualization with Tkinter
This project implements a visualization of the Fibonacci heap data structure using the Python Tkinter library. It provides a graphical representation of the Fibonacci heap, as well as a step-by-step visualization of the basic operations performed on the heap, such as insert, extract min, and decrease key.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (should be included in standard Python distribution)
# Usage
To run the visualization, open the fibonacci_heap.py file in a Python IDE and click the "run" button. This will launch the Tkinter GUI, which provides a run buttons for displaying the Fibonacci heap. The visualization updates in real-time as you perform operations, allowing you to see the effects of each operation on the structure of the heap.

## Features
Real-time visualization of Fibonacci heap structure
Step-by-step visualization of basic operations (insert, extract min, and decrease key)
Interactive GUI with buttons for running animation

## Conclusion
The Fibonacci heap visualization with Tkinter is a valuable tool for those interested in learning about this data structure and its operations. The real-time visualization provides a clear and interactive way to understand the behavior of the heap, making it a valuable resource for both students and professionals alike.


# AVL Tree Visualization using Tkinter
This is an implementation of an AVL Tree visualization using Tkinter and Python. The AVL Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree and is widely used in computer science due to its efficient searching and insertion/deletion algorithms. This visualization allows you to interact with the tree by inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes, while also providing a graphical representation of the tree and its properties.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the visualization, you will need to install the following packages:

Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
Running the Visualization
To run the visualization, simply run the avl_tree_visualization.py file using a Python interpreter. You should see a window pop up displaying the AVL Tree.

## Interacting with the Visualization
To run the visualization, simply run the avl_animation.py file using a Python interpreter.
The visualization provides several buttons that allow you to interact with the tree:

Insert: Allows you to insert a new node into the tree.
Delete: Allows you to delete a node from the tree.
Find: Allows you to search for a node in the tree.

When you insert a node, you will be prompted to enter a value for the new node. Similarly, when you delete or search for a node, you will be prompted to enter the value of the node you want to delete or search for.

The visualization also displays the properties of each node, such as its value, height, and parent/child relationships.

## Conclusion
This AVL Tree visualization is a useful tool for learning about self-balancing binary search trees and their properties. By providing an interactive interface and graphical representation, it allows you to better understand the workings of AVL Trees and their algorithms.

    
# Red-Black Tree Visualization in Python using Tkinter
This is an implementation of a Red-Black Tree visualization in Python using Tkinter. The Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree and is widely used in computer science due to its efficient searching and insertion/deletion algorithms. This visualization allows you to interact with the tree by inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes, while also providing a graphical representation of the tree and its properties. It allows you to initially run a preset animation for the red-black tree

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the visualization, you will need to install the following packages:

Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
## Running the Visualization
To run the visualization, simply run the red_black_tree_visualization.py file using a Python interpreter. You should see a window pop up displaying the run button to visualize the Red-Black Tree. From there you can insert, delete, and search for nodes

## Interacting with the Visualization
The visualization provides several buttons that allow you to interact with the tree:

Insert: Allows you to insert a new node into the tree.
Delete: Allows you to delete a node from the tree.
Search: Allows you to search for a node in the tree.
Run: Runs an animation of inserting into a Red-Black Tree

When you insert a node, you will be prompted to enter a value for the new node. Similarly, when you delete or search for a node, you will be prompted to enter the value of the node you want to delete or search for.

The visualization also displays the properties of each node, such as its value, color, and parent/child relationships. It highlights the most recently inserted node, the searched for node, attempts at duplicate insertions, recolored nodes, and node that have rotated.

## Conclusion
This Red-Black Tree visualization is a useful tool for learning about self-balancing binary search trees and their properties. By providing an interactive interface and graphical representation, it allows you to better understand the workings of Red-Black Trees and their algorithms.
